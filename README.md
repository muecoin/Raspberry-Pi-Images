# Raspberry-Pi-Images
MUE builds of Raspbian with the Monetaryunit wallet installed

The Monetaryunit team have made it easy to use the Monetaryunit wallet on your Raspberry Pi, by making a prebuilt image for your convenience. 

The images are based off Raspbian April release of 2019-04: 

    Version:        April 2019
    Release date:   2019-04-08
    Kernel version: 4.14

and have the **Monetaryunit 2.1.3 wallet** installed but not configured. The user will need to log in to the raspberry pi with login: `pi` and password: `raspberry` and do any configuring to the pi desktop system and the Monetaryunit wallet before using the wallet.

Running the Raspberry Pi, the user can use the wallet as a dedicated staking box or as a cold storage masternode wallet. In both cases the wallet will need to have coins sent to it. Please make sure to make several encrypted backups to keep your wallet and coins safe.
